GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
============================================================
Here’s what the footage and the captured game data together show.

1) What happens in the video frames
- Position and context: You’re on Olympus (pink cherry trees visible), holding an angle down a Pathfinder zipline lane from cover beside a structure/rock face. Round 1 is closing, and only 4 squads remain.
- Weapon in hand: Sentinel. The HUD shows “Hold T to Charge,” meaning you could amp the next shot with a shield cell. Your stowed secondary is an R-99 with an 18‑round mag (base magazine).
- Squad state: Both teammates are dead; you’re carrying their banners. The center/right HUD shows “Respawn Teammates at Beacons,” and a teammate/you have pinged a respawn beacon ahead (green beacon icon visible at distance).
- Under fire: While ADSing down the zipline corridor, you take return fire (screen flash/red vignette, third frame), forcing you to break aim and work the action on the Sentinel (reload/cycle shown in the fourth frame). You’re holding position and trying to keep the lane contested while also looking for a safe window to rotate toward a beacon.

2) Correlation with the game data
- Weapons used:
  - Visuals: Sentinel is used throughout these frames; the HUD shows the stowed R-99 with 18 in the mag.
  - Data stream: After these frames, the API shows you swapped to the R‑99 (“inUse”: “R-99”) and then later to “Health/Shield.”
- Damage and kills progression:
  - Match tab initially: 2 kills, 476 damage, 4 squads left.
  - Total damage ticks in the feed: 515 → 528 → 541 → 554 → 593 → 619 → 632 → 655.
  - Event log: Multiple flesh hits on “SequenceSlayer” for 13, 13, 13, and 10 (armor: false, headshot: false), which fits a close‑range SMG cleanup after the Sentinel peek didn’t finish them.
  - Match tab updates later to 3 kills, 626 damage, squads drop from 4 to 3 — consistent with you securing a down/finish and/or contributing to a squad being eliminated.
- Game phase:
  - The overlay says “Round 1 – Closing,” which matches the early ring, but the lobby is already very thinned out (4→3 squads).
- Inventory:
  - Inventory_4: “unknown_166” amount 64 — likely a stack of Light Rounds (fits the R‑99).
  - Inventory_10: empty ({}).
  - After the skirmish, “inUse: Health/Shield” indicates you started healing/shielding (also consistent with having just taken damage in the frames and with Sentinel’s “charge” mechanic consuming shield cells if you chose to use it).

3) Key moments (combat, looting, movement, team interactions)
- Combat:
  - Long‑range lane hold with the Sentinel while watching a zipline approach.
  - You take significant return fire mid‑peek (visible damage), disengage the scope, and cycle/reload the Sentinel.
  - Shortly afterward (beyond the pictured frames), you swap to the R‑99 and land several body shots on an unshielded enemy (SequenceSlayer), indicated by the repeated 13/10 flesh hit events.
- Movement:
  - You’re controlling a zipline corridor rather than hard‑pushing — likely because you’re solo with banners and need a safe route.
- Team interactions:
  - Both teammates are eliminated; the UI prompt “Respawn Teammates at Beacons” is active.
  - A respawn beacon is pinged ahead (green marker). The plan appears to be: hold off pressure, win the immediate fight, heal, then look to rotate for a respawn.
- Looting:
  - No looting is shown in these frames. The focus is on holding the angle and surviving the return fire.

4) Sequence of events and outcome
- You start by anchoring a sightline with the Sentinel while solo with both banners, 4 squads left.
- You get tagged while scoped and break LOS, cycling the Sentinel.
- Shortly after, you transition to the R‑99 and finish a close‑range engagement, landing multiple flesh hits on SequenceSlayer. Your damage climbs from the 500s into the mid‑600s.
- Your kill count increases from 2 to 3, and the squads drop from 4 to 3, suggesting you secured or contributed to an elimination.
- You then begin healing/shielding (per “inUse: Health/Shield”). The footage stops before we see whether you reach the respawn beacon, but your immediate outcome is positive: you win the skirmish, stabilize, and set up for a potential respawn attempt with three squads remaining.
