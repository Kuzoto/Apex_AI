GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
============================================================
Here’s what the video frames show and how they line up with the provided game data.

1) Key actions/events shown in the video
- Endgame context: You’re in the final fight (2 squads left). The environment and UI elements indicate Olympus.
- Weapon and legend: You’re playing Valkyrie and using a Sentinel sniper rifle (prompt shows “E to charge” for the Sentinel).
- Opening posture: You’re holding a tight angle from behind cover near a yellow silo/pipe assembly, ADS with the Sentinel. The HUD shows a reload prompt at times, suggesting the mag is empty or nearly empty.
- Big damage swing: You land a 70-damage body shot that cracks an enemy Seer’s shields (“Enemy shield broken – Seer” appears).
- Return fire and low shields: You immediately take return fire and your own shields get broken. The “Your shields are low” tip pops up.
- Heal decision/cancel: You start a Phoenix Kit (red progress animation visible), then cancel it to re-peek as pressure continues.
- Continued pressure: You try to re-engage with the Sentinel while the enemy is on flesh, but the “Reload” prompt appears, delaying a follow-up shot.
- Team positioning: Teammate ShadyCloud74 pushes up the left side of the yellow silo to take space; DevDynamo remains alive and positioned elsewhere providing presence.

2) Correlating visuals with the game data
- Teams remaining: The HUD’s “2 squads left” matches the API tabs field showing teams: 2.
- Player performance: Tabs show kills: 3, damage: 696. Visually, you crack an enemy Seer for 70 with the Sentinel in this sequence, consistent with ongoing late-game damage accumulation around that 696 mark.
- Damage event: The API logs a 20 flesh hit to “CoefficientConqueror” (armor: false, headshot: false). In the frames, we specifically see a 70 shield-break on a Seer and subsequent flesh pressure. That 20 flesh event likely occurred in this same endgame exchange (not explicitly visible in these stills) as you took follow-up shots/trades after breaking armor.
- Teammates: The API lists DevDynamo as alive, which matches the HUD (both teammates are up; ShadyCloud74 is visibly pushing).
- Inventory alignment: API shows an item “unknown_170” with amount 23. On-screen, your Sentinel shows 51 sniper ammo in reserve; “unknown_170” is consistent with an ammo-type count. You also visibly have and initiate a Phoenix Kit (consumables present).
- Weapon state: The UI repeatedly prompts “Reload,” consistent with the Sentinel’s limited mag and your timing around peeks. The “E to charge” prompt indicates the Sentinel isn’t charged for boosted shots.

3) Important moments (combat, looting, movement, team interactions)
- Combat:
  - Sentinel 70 body shot that breaks a Seer’s shields (key momentum shift).
  - You get cracked in return; immediate risk management follows.
- Healing:
  - Start a Phoenix Kit to reset both health and shields, then cancel to avoid getting caught mid-heal as the enemy threatens your angle.
- Movement/positioning:
  - Tight shoulder peeks from hard cover along the yellow rail/silo to minimize exposure.
  - Teammate ShadyCloud74 advances to apply pressure from a new angle; you maintain anchor/cover fire.
- Team dynamics:
  - Clear role split: you anchor with long-range pressure while a teammate pushes to capitalize on the armor crack. DevDynamo remains alive, ready to contribute from another angle.

4) Sequence of events and overall outcome
- Sequence:
  1) Hold angle with Sentinel, low on/empty mag (reload prompt appears).
  2) Peek and land a 70-damage body shot, cracking a Seer’s shields.
  3) Take return fire; your shields break.
  4) Begin Phoenix Kit to fully reset; cancel mid-use due to enemy pressure.
  5) Re-peek for follow-up on a now-flesh enemy; the Sentinel needs a reload, slowing the finish.
  6) ShadyCloud74 pushes the left side to pressure/collapse on the cracked target; DevDynamo stays up.
- Outcome:
  - The final result of the fight isn’t shown in these frames. No confirmed knock/finish is visible here, but your team has the initiative (broken enemy armor, numbers advantage intact) heading into the closing moments of the last-squad engagement.

In short: This is a final-circle skirmish on Olympus where you, as Valkyrie with an uncharged Sentinel, crack a Seer with a 70 body shot, get cracked in return, briefly commit to a Phoenix then cancel to keep pressure, while a teammate pushes off your damage. The API data aligns with two squads left, your current stat line (3 kills, 696 damage), an earlier/adjacent 20 flesh hit on a different enemy, and your team’s alive status heading into the decisive exchange.
