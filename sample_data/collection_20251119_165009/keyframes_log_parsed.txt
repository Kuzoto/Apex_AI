GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
============================================================
Here’s what the clip shows and how it lines up with the API data:

1) What happens in the video
- Setting and context: You’re on Olympus (industrial catwalks and large yellow tanks, pink trees in view) with 2 squads left. The ring timer is ticking (~0:39) — this is the final fight setup.
- Opening posture: You’re hard-holding a head‑glitch/cover behind a big red valve wheel, ADS with a Sentinel. The weapon is empty and you start a reload while peeking the lane.
- First key shot: You shoulder peek and land a body shot for 70 on an enemy Seer, and the HUD confirms “Enemy Shield Broken – Seer.” You take return fire — the red vignette and on‑screen prompt (“Your shields are low…”) indicate your shields are cracked/very low.
- Pressure vs heal: Despite being low, you keep the angle instead of immediately popping a shield cell/battery. You slide out to the yellow ramp/rail to widen the angle and maintain pressure on the cracked Seer who’s retreating around the large yellow tank.
- Team posture: Teammate “ShadowDruid42” is already forward on the lane, trading pressure near the tank. “DevDynamo” is alive and supporting, per team list; you’re playing a backline anchor with the Sentinel.
- No looting: The entire sequence is combat positioning and shots; there’s no looting, crafting, or ultimate usage shown. The outcome isn’t shown — the clip ends with you still holding the angle on the Seer.

2) Correlation with the provided game data
- Squads/phase: The HUD shows “2 squads left,” matching the API tabs { "teams": 2 }. This is the endgame.
- Teammates: The API says teammate_1 is "DevDynamo" alive — matches the squad list on screen. All three of you are up during this clip.
- Combat events: The API damage event records 20 flesh damage on "CoefficientConqueror" (armor: false). In the video we see a 70 body shot that breaks Seer’s shield; the 20 flesh tick in the data likely happened just before/after this visible exchange (a follow-up tag on the same enemy or a different opponent off-camera). It’s consistent with ongoing poke damage in this final engagement.
- Kills/damage: Tabs show { "kills": 3, "damage": 696 }. The clip doesn’t show a new knock/finish, so those numbers likely remain unchanged through these frames.
- Weapons/inventory:
  - You’re using a Sentinel (bottom-right weapon HUD, “T/DT to charge” prompt visible). The body shot for 70 indicates an uncharged Sentinel hit (70 base), which was enough to break the Seer’s remaining shields.
  - The UI shows you can “charge” the Sentinel (consumes a shield cell), aligning with the idea that you have shield cells available. The inventory line unknown_170 x23 is likely a consumable (very plausibly shield cells given the Sentinel charge prompt and the large quantity), though the API label is generic.
  - Ammo reserve shows plenty of sniper ammo (e.g., 51 in reserve visible), so you’re not ammo‑starved, just caught mid‑reload during the first peek.

3) Important moments and team interactions
- Key combat beats:
  - Mid‑reload peek with Sentinel, then immediate body shot for 70 that cracks the Seer.
  - Decision point: you keep the sightline rather than heal, leveraging teammate pressure to try to convert the crack.
- Movement:
  - Micro‑reposition from a tight head‑glitch behind the machinery to a wider angle along the yellow rail, aiming to catch the cracked Seer crossing or re-peeking.
- Team play:
  - “ShadowDruid42” is forward and drawing/adding pressure, creating a window for your long‑range follow‑up. “DevDynamo” remains alive and supporting per HUD/data, maintaining full trio strength in the last fight.

4) Sequence and outcome
- Sequence:
  1) Hold cover and reload Sentinel.
  2) Shoulder peek and land a 70 body shot; enemy Seer’s shields break.
  3) You take return fire; shields are low.
  4) You swing to a slightly wider lane along the yellow rail to capitalize on the crack, still ADS with the Sentinel.
  5) Teammate is already close to the Seer’s position, likely pressuring the retreat.
- Outcome: Not shown in the frames. The fight is in progress with your team holding the advantage of a cracked enemy at the endgame, but you’re vulnerable until you heal or secure a knock.

Overall: The visuals and HUD perfectly match the API data — final two squads, DevDynamo alive, 3 kills/696 damage so far, and a live damage exchange (including the recorded 20 flesh tick) in a last‑circle fight where you’re playing a backline Sentinel to crack and force an enemy Seer off position.
