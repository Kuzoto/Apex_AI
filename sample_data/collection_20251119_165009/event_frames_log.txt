Here’s a structured recap of the match based on the log data and the two screenshots:

Match state and stats
- Late game: 2 squads left (final duel).
- Your tally at this point: 3 kills, 0 assists, 696 damage.
- You’re running a Sentinel with Deadeye’s Tempo, and the rifle is charged. One round is chambered during the key shots shown.
- Your evo shield is purple (UI shows “NEXT LVL 388 EVO,” meaning 388 damage needed to reach red).

Team status
- Team frames are up; at least one teammate is confirmed alive from logs (DevDynamo). In the screenshots, your squad UI shows all three frames present (no obvious death/respawn indicators).
- You’re under pressure during the fight (red vignette on the screen edges).

Key combat sequence (final two squads)
1) 0:41 on the ring timer (first screenshot)
   - You’re scoped with the Sentinel, tracking a red-highlighted enemy at roughly 35 meters.
   - Positioning is around industrial cover; you’re lining up a shot with the Sentinel’s charge active.

2) 0:33 on the ring timer (second screenshot)
   - You close the distance to very close range (around 11 meters).
   - You land a 70-damage body shot with the Sentinel on an enemy Seer.
   - The hit cracks their shield (UI: “Enemy Shield Broken – Seer”), likely creating a window to push or secure a knock.

Other logged event
- Separate damage event recorded: 20 damage to health (no armor, no headshot) on a player named “CoefficientConqueror.” This was flesh damage, suggesting a cleanup chip on a low/downswing target at some point in the match.

What this means for the match flow
- By the time only two squads remained, you had already secured 3 kills with 696 total damage.
- In the final engagement, you used a charged Sentinel to open/continue the fight by cracking the enemy Seer’s shields at close range, while your squad remained active.
- The provided data doesn’t show a confirmed knock or the match outcome after the shield break, but the sequence indicates you created a strong advantage to capitalize on in the last fight.
