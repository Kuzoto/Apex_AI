GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
============================================================
Here’s a detailed breakdown of what the subsequent video frames show and how they line up with the telemetry you provided.

1) What the video shows (key actions and visuals)
- Frame 1: You’re aiming into a tight corridor/walkway between two large yellow cylindrical structures on a bright, clean, futuristic map (this looks like Olympus). An enemy legend in a pink/white outfit is caught mid-rotation, glancing back toward you while moving through the gap.
- Frame 2: The enemy turns more toward you, still exposed in the lane between the two tanks. There are faint red/orange streaks in the background (likely environmental or ability effects), but nothing that suggests the enemy is actively using a defensive ability right now.
- Frame 3: The screen flashes to near-white, indicating either the immediate aftermath of an explosive/flash effect or, more likely in this context, a transition into the end-of-fight/end-of-match sequence.

2) Correlation with the game data (weapons, phase, inventory, damage)
- Match context/phase:
  - The tab summary shows kills: 4, assists: 0, teams: 2. That means you’re in the final two squads during this sequence.
  - Your running damage totals increase throughout the clip: 831 → 844 → 857 → 870 → 896 → 912 → 957. The match tab’s damage reaches 1025, which is consistent with UI/stat updates landing slightly out of sync with the “me.totalDamageDealt” values.

- Damage sequence on the same target:
  - The telemetry lists multiple hits on “StatisticSharpshooter” in this order (paraphrased):
    - 13 damage to armor (shield)
    - 13 damage to flesh
    - 13 damage to flesh (a second 13 on flesh occurs around this period)
    - 16 headshot to flesh
    - 16 headshot to flesh
  - That sequence matches what you’d expect when you chip down the last opponent: you crack or finish their shield (13 to armor), then land flesh damage, and finally confirm the fight with a couple of headshots.

- Likely weapon:
  - The pattern 13 body shots and 16 headshots on flesh strongly suggests an SMG with headshot reduction from a helmet on the target. The CAR SMG is a strong candidate:
    - CAR body shots commonly read as 13.
    - Headshots often register as 16 when a helmet reduces the headshot multiplier.
  - While the game data doesn’t explicitly name the weapon, those specific numbers (13 body, 16 head with helmet mitigation) line up well with CAR SMG behavior.

- Inventory:
  - “inventory_4” shows an item “unknown_166” with amount 44. The label isn’t resolved, but a count of 44 fits an ammo stack rather than throwables/consumables. Given the likely CAR usage, this is probably light or heavy ammo in reserve.

3) Important moments: combat, movement, team interactions, looting
- Combat:
  - This is a close/short mid-range clean-up in a narrow lane. You catch the enemy exposed between the tanks, tag them through shields and flesh, then finish with two headshots.
- Movement/positioning:
  - You’re holding a strong angle into a choke on Olympus. The enemy is rotating through a tight gap and gets punished for it.
- Team interactions:
  - Tab shows assists: 0, which implies you secured this damage and likely the down/finish yourself. No explicit evidence of teammate involvement is visible in these frames (there is a partial leg on the extreme left in Frame 1, but it’s not clear if that’s an ally or another enemy, and there’s no assist recorded).
- Looting:
  - No looting occurs in these frames; it’s a pure end-fight exchange.

4) Sequence and outcome
- Sequence:
  - Enter final two squads (tabs show teams: 2).
  - Engage “StatisticSharpshooter”: chip shield (13), then land flesh damage (13, 13), then two finishing headshots (16, 16).
  - Your total damage climbs from 896 → 912 (first 16 headshot) → 957 (subsequent hits), and the match tab’s damage reaches 1025.
  - The last frame flashes white, consistent with a post-fight transition (very plausibly the Champion/win transition given there were only two squads remaining).

- Outcome:
  - The data confirms a decisive end to that duel. Since the tab still showed 2 squads during this sequence and then you immediately land the final shots followed by a white-out, the most likely outcome is that this knock/elimination ended the match in your favor. Note: the “kill” counter in the provided events was already at 4 earlier and didn’t log a new “kill” event here, so either the system didn’t capture that specific increment in this snippet, or this damage concluded the last remaining opponent’s health (e.g., final flesh damage on the last member) leading straight into the end screen.

In short: In the final ring phase on Olympus, you catch the last opposing player rotating through a narrow lane, strip the remaining shield, land two headshots (likely with a CAR SMG), and the clip transitions to a white-out consistent with the match concluding—very likely a win.
