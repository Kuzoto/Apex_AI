GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
============================================================
Here’s a concise, event-by-event breakdown of what happens in these frames of Apex Legends (Bot Royale):

Overview
- Mode: Bot Royale (play against bot squads in a smaller, faster BR variant).
- Map/POI: Olympus — Gravity Engine. “Grow Towers” is visible in the distance during the drop.
- Squad: Trio. Player POV is c0okies3, with teammates ShadyDracoXD (Jumpmaster) and DevDynamo.
- Squads left: 9 at the start of the drop, then 8 by the time you land/loot.

Drop and Landing
- Your squad follows Jumpmaster ShadyDracoXD from the dropship toward Gravity Engine.
- You stay tethered to the Jumpmaster most of the way, then break off and aim for the rooftop section with the circular central hub and surrounding catwalks.
- All three teammates land on the roof with good spacing: ShadyDracoXD targets the center hub; DevDynamo touches down off to the left; you land near an outer catwalk/hatch area on the roof.

Early Looting Sequence
- You run straight to an orange/white supply bin on the rooftop and open it.
- Items seen/picked up around the bin:
  - RE-45 Burst (3-round burst sidearm) — you equip it.
  - A Med Kit — you pick it up.
  - Energy Ammo x36 — initially flagged “Not compatible with any of your weapons.”
- After a moment, you pull out an energy sidearm/weapon (your HUD shows 15 in mag with 36 reserve Energy Ammo), making energy ammo compatible. You then have both a sidearm and energy ammo in your inventory.
- You briefly inspect your melee/Heirloom while looting and viewing tutorial prompts. The game displays tooltips about loot bins, ammo compatibility, and Med Kits.

Positioning and Team Activity
- You remain on the rooftop at the Gravity Engine, scanning the area and loot on the ground near the central hub.
- A ground weapon (an SMG) is in front of ShadyDracoXD by a roof hatch; you look at it but keep your current loadout.
- DevDynamo is looting and moving across the roof.
- You mark/request Energy Ammo at one point, but otherwise keep looting quietly.

Combat/Encounters
- No combat occurs in these frames. No shots at enemies, no incoming fire, and no enemy squad contact on the roof.
- Kill count for the squad remains 0. The only shots fired are a couple of test shots at the floor while evaluating the weapon (not at enemies).
- Squads drop from 9 to 8 while you’re looting (action likely elsewhere on the map).

Status as these frames end
- Location: Still on the Gravity Engine rooftop.
- Ring: Early-game; ring countdown tutorial prompts are visible.
- Team: All three alive, white (Level 1) EVO shields, full health. Inventory includes a Med Kit and mixed ammo; you’re holding an energy sidearm with a small mag.
- Plan implied: Finish rooftop sweep, move into the interior of Gravity Engine for more loot, then rotate.

Notable details
- Skydive emote/music is shown on the right (Prodigy Split: Sparrow).
- Tutorial hints pop up about tactical usage, loot bins, and med kits (standard for the mode/first-time context).
- The drop is uncontested, giving your squad a clean, safe start.

In short: Your trio takes a safe, uncontested drop onto Gravity Engine, spreads across the roof, opens a supply bin, equips an RE-45 Burst, then swaps to/loots an energy sidearm plus a Med Kit. No fights break out; the squad stabilizes gear on the roof and looks ready to rotate inside for more loot as the ring timer progresses.
