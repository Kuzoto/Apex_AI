Here’s what I can confirm from the provided log and screenshot, in sequence:

1) Landing and early setup
- Phase: The match data shows you had already landed.
- Loadout: You picked up an RE-45 Auto right after landing. A second weapon slot was present but not yet identified/filled at that time.
- Ultimate: The log reports an ultimate cooldown of 0 (i.e., not cooling down at that moment), implying it hadn’t been used yet or was available depending on legend.
- Early inventory: You had at least two item stacks (IDs not labeled in the log), one with 36 units (likely ammo) and one with 4 units (likely consumables, e.g., shield cells or syringes). Exact types aren’t explicit in the log.

2) Mid-game state at Gravity Engine
- Location and timing: The screenshot shows you at Gravity Engine with the team looting a bin. The ring timer shows there’s still over a minute left in the current round phase.
- Squads remaining: 9 squads left, indicating you’ve reached mid-game without your squad being wiped.
- Team status: All three teammates are alive; no one is downed or bannered. No skull/knock indicators are present.
- Your loadout now:
  - RE-45 Auto equipped with a 15-round mag and 135 light ammo in reserve.
  - Second weapon slot is not visible/confirmed; likely still unfilled or not selected in this moment.
- Armor and EVO progress: Your HUD shows “NEXT LVL: 450 EVO,” meaning you need 450 damage to reach the next armor tier from your current EVO level. This suggests little or no recent damage dealt since your last upgrade, and no visible recent engagements.
- Looting details: The open bin contains a Med Kit (red), a Shield Cell (blue), and a 1x optic (green). You’re in a standard looting phase, not in combat.

3) Combat and events summary
- Kills/knockdowns: There’s no evidence in the provided data of you or your squad securing kills or knockdowns up to this point.
- Damage dealt: No damage numbers or EVO progress changes are shown; the 450-to-next-tier indicator implies limited or no recent damage.
- Revives/respawns: None indicated.
- Match progression: You’ve rotated into mid-game with 9 squads remaining, full squad alive, and are continuing to loot and prepare at Gravity Engine.

Bottom line: After landing, you secured an RE-45 and basic supplies, stayed out of fights (or at least didn’t secure downs/kills), and reached mid-game with 9 squads left while your full team looted at Gravity Engine. No confirmed engagements, knocks, or kills are visible in the provided evidence.
