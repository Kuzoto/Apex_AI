GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
============================================================
Here’s a concise, chronological breakdown of what the frames show from this Apex Legends sequence:

Context and setup
- Squad: Full trio alive. You’re playing Seer (heartbeat sensor visible while ADS; red diamonds appear on scans).
- Loadout: A mid-range rifle with 18 rounds per mag (likely R-301) and a Sentinel sniper (2x-4x optic). Blue EVO armor (level 2).
- Location: An industrial complex/courtyard with large yellow cylindrical tanks, catwalks, and crates (open lanes and plenty of cover).
- Game state: Starts with 5 squads left during Round 1; by the end it’s down to the final 2 squads (6 players total).

Early movement and positioning
- You begin tucked behind a shipping container, peeking toward the open yard. You take light chip damage while shouldering the angle.
- You climb onto a low wall for a better line, then inch up to a catwalk using cover (containers, crate stacks, railings).
- You use Seer’s passive (heartbeat sensor) and then tactical to scan—enemies get marked with red diamonds at roughly 50–60 meters across the yard on the upper walkway.

Mid-round control and scouting
- You ping enemy positions multiple times (teammate pings also appear, including a mobile respawn beacon earlier).
- You swap to the Sentinel, chamber it, and spend a Shield Cell to “charge” it (the charge animation is shown). You hold angles with the 2x-4x scope, watching long sightlines (80–120 meters) into doorways and a balcony across the complex.
- You keep advancing methodically: wall → catwalk → around a large yellow tank, always using cover and rechecking with ADS for heartbeat pings.
- No confirmed shots landed in the frames—this phase is about information, marks, and holding advantageous angles while the lobby thins (squads drop from 5 → 3).

Endgame setup
- You post up on a bridge/headglitch overlooking the final engagement area (enemy pings ~70–100 meters).
- A Gibraltar Dome of Protection pops on the far side (blue bubble), signaling a defensive push/rez or a team under pressure. Shortly after, you start taking incoming fire.
- The HUD shows 2 squads left (6 alive), indicating the final 3v3 is about to kick off. You’re still in good cover, Sentinel ready, watching the bubble and the lanes around it.

Key takeaways
- Strong, patient macro: you rotate into a powerful position, maintain cover, and let other squads fight as the count drops.
- Information-first Seer play: frequent ADS checks for heartbeat, a well-timed tactical scan to mark enemies for the team, and steady pings to coordinate.
- Loadout synergy: R-301 (or similar) for midrange and a charged Sentinel to punish peeks across long lanes.
- Final moments show a Gibraltar bubble ahead and you under light fire—everything is set for the last fight, but these frames stop just before the engagement fully unfolds.

No knocks/finishes are shown in these frames; the sequence captures smart positioning, scouting, and pre-fight setup leading into the final 2-squad showdown.
