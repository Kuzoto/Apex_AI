GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
============================================================
Here’s a detailed, frame-by-frame synthesis of what’s happening in the clip and how it lines up with the provided API data.

High-level overview
- Location: Olympus, Gravity Engine POI.
- Legend: You’re playing Octane (stim icon visible).
- Armor: Blue Evo (Level 2), “NEXT LVL: 32 EVO” shows you’re 32 damage from purple.
- Squad: Full trio at the time of these frames; a teammate pings a Mobile Respawn Beacon, suggesting a recent or potential respawn.
- Ring state: Starts during Round 1 closing, then most of the action happens as Round 2 is closing (~55 seconds on the timer).
- Loadout across the sequence:
  - Long-range: Sentinel (with Deadeye’s Tempo prompt) for scouting/pokes.
  - Mid-range: Bocek Compound Bow (28 arrows, also using Deadeye’s Tempo).
  - Close-range: SMG with 1x Digital Threat (likely R-99 or C.A.R.) with 18 in mag, 64 reserve.

Key actions and events (chronological)
1) Early positioning (Frames 1, 12–20)
- You’re posted on the outskirts near the Gravity Engine structure, using cover by the corner building and catwalks. The HUD shows 5 squads left at first, and “Round 1 – closing.”
- You ready an SMG for near‑to‑mid engagements, then briefly switch between angles, lining up a route to push in on the left-side railings and boxes.

2) Long-range scouting with Sentinel (Frames 2–4)
- As Round 2 is closing (timer ~0:55), you ADS with a long-range scope on the Sentinel, ranging targets at ~90m inside the building. You briefly de-scope and reload/ready the rifle (ammo appears to be partially spent).
- The Deadeye’s Tempo/charge prompt appears on screen, indicating the Sentinel’s charge mechanic is available.

3) Mid-range pressure with the Bocek Bow (Frames 5–9)
- You swap from the Sentinel to a Bocek (28 arrows), repeatedly drawing on targets at 71–66 meters. The Deadeye’s Tempo prompt persists, now relevant to the Bocek’s fire rhythm.
- You strafe and micro-adjust angles while holding draw, looking to capitalize on mid-range poke damage.
- This phase signals a shift in intent: after scouting with the Sentinel, you commit to consistent ranged chip with the Bocek.

4) Enemy defensive cooldown and close-range prep (Frames 10–11)
- A Gibraltar Dome Shield goes down near the enemy’s position (blue bubble), which blocks your lines of sight and likely covers their heal/res.
- You swap to your close-range SMG with a 1x Digital Threat (18 in mag, 64 reserve), signaling a push is coming once they’re stuck behind the dome or once it expires.
- Around here, the feed/hud shows the lobby thinning fast. In one frame, the top-right indicator shows a drop to 2 squads left (matching the API data’s teams: 2).

5) Push/rotation to better angles (Frames 12–20)
- You move from the exterior corner onto the catwalk/rail path, using boxes and railing head-glitches for cover while keeping the SMG out for a close-range fight.
- You consistently peek toward the central Gravity Engine platform and the front of the building, setting up a collapse once the dome and distance advantages fade.
- The ring state shows Round 2 closing/countdown continuing; by the final frame the ring timer is refreshed at 0:59 for Round 2 (indicating a transition in ring state or a snapshot just after a close).

Correlating with the API data
- me.inUse: “Sentinel”
  - Matches the mid-clip usage where you ADS and scout/poke with a long-range optic. You then transition to the Bocek and finally to an SMG as you close distance.
- match_info.tabs: kills 3, assists 0, damage 626, teams 2
  - The frames themselves don’t show the kill count pop-ups, but you are clearly in late game: the HUD shows 5 squads at first and then drops rapidly, with an explicit “2 squads left” during the Bocek/SMG phase (consistent with “teams: 2”).
  - 626 damage and 3 kills indicate you were impactful—likely landing solid poke with the Sentinel/Bocek and cleaning up at closer ranges. The Blue Evo needing only 32 damage to level up to purple fits with sustained mid-range pokes that stacked damage.

Important moments identified
- Combat:
  - Long-range Sentinel scouting and potential tags at ~90m.
  - Sustained Bocek pressure at 66–71m, leveraging Deadeye’s Tempo for faster follow-up shots.
  - Enemy Gibraltar Dome appears—clear sign of defensive reset/heal or cover to disengage.
  - Weapon swap to SMG with Digi-Threat—preparing to capitalize at close range and to track enemies through smoke/cover if needed.
- Movement:
  - Careful lane control from the outer corner to the catwalk/rail, taking high-ground angles and hard cover near the boxes.
  - Intentional angle shifts to maintain LOS while the enemy dome is active.
- Team interactions:
  - Teammate pinged a Mobile Respawn Beacon (top-right message), suggesting awareness of respawn options—likely because a teammate was downed earlier or to ensure safety in late game.
  - Trio remains coordinated; no explicit revives are shown in these frames, but the ping hints at contingency planning.
- Looting:
  - No looting is shown in these frames—focus is entirely on positioning, poking, and preparing a push.

Sequence and outcome
- Sequence: You begin with safe, long-range info gathering (Sentinel), transition into mid-range chip (Bocek), trigger/observe an enemy Gibraltar Dome, and then rotate in with an SMG and Digi-Threat to set up a close-quarters collapse.
- Outcome visible in frames: The clip ends just as you’re moving into a strong close-range angle; the fight resolution isn’t shown.
- Outcome per data: By the time the API snapshot was taken, you had 3 kills, 626 total damage, and your squad was in the final 2. That implies you survived subsequent engagements after these frames and reached the last matchup (top 2), with a strong individual contribution.

Notable details and tells
- Deadeye’s Tempo hop-up is in play for both the Sentinel and Bocek phases.
- Blue Evo is nearly at purple (32 dmg to go), consistent with the 626 damage total.
- SMG has a 1x Digital Threat—ideal for close quarters and synergizes with pushing into areas where enemies might smoke or hide behind cover.
- The enemy’s Gibraltar Dome timing suggests they were pressured by your ranged pokes and needed to heal/reset before you pushed.

In short: This clip shows a disciplined late-game push setup. You gather info and tag with the Sentinel, apply steady ranged pressure with the Bocek, force a Gibraltar Dome, and then begin a coordinated close-range collapse with an SMG and Digi-Threat. The API data confirms a strong performance (3 kills, 626 damage) and that you made it to the final 2 squads.
