GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
============================================================
Here’s what the next moments in the clip show and how they line up with the telemetry you provided:

1) What’s happening on-screen
- You (Wraith, with heirloom ownership indicated by the karambit entry) are in a close-range brawl. Your hands are up with a glowing punch animation, indicating you’re using a special melee/charge gauntlet state rather than firing a gun.
- The enemy in front of you is already on flesh (no shields); their health bar is low and you’re closing in to finish with a melee hit.
- A teammate is visible to the right providing presence/pressure while you move in. You’re fighting in an open plaza area with hard cover crates just ahead.
- HUD shows 2 squads left, so this is the endgame.

2) Correlating with the game data
- Weapons/items in use:
  - The feed shows you briefly had the Wraith karambit out (mp_weapon_agnostic_karambit_primary), then swapped to Sentinel, and finally to a charge-style gauntlet (mp_weapon_charge_gauntlet). That matches the visual: you’re not aiming a gun here—you’re going for a charged punch finish.
  - Bottom-right HUD shows Sentinel and 8 rounds available, aligning with the “inUse: Sentinel” moment right before you switched to melee to secure the close-range finish.
- Damage and targets:
  - Two separate damage events of 13 to “StatisticSharpshooter” with armor=false and headshot=false appear in the log. That’s consistent with small body-hit ticks on an already unshielded opponent during a hectic close-range cleanup.
  - A “knockdown” event fired shortly after the initial damage tick, and your totalDamageDealt increments steadily (983 → 1048, then up through 1077).
  - Match tabs progress from kills=4, damage=1026 to kills=5, damage=1126. The scene you’re seeing is the tail end of that sequence: you close distance and finish, which aligns with the kill count bump to 5.
- Inventory changes:
  - inventory_4 unknown_166 drops from 35 to 17 by the end of the sequence. While the specific item ID isn’t labeled, the decrease fits with resources being spent in the skirmish (ammo/consumables or a special event item) as you swap and push for the finish.

3) Key moments in this segment
- Combat:
  - You tag “StatisticSharpshooter” for small body damage (two 13-tick hits on flesh).
  - A knockdown occurs in this exchange (event logged).
  - You swap off the Sentinel and commit to a melee/charge gauntlet finisher at point-blank range, which appears to secure the elimination.
- Team play:
  - A teammate is visible nearby, helping contain angles while you push. The quick finish suggests coordinated pressure to prevent the downed opponent from escaping or getting support.
- Movement/positioning:
  - You close through open space toward cover, choosing melee to end the fight quickly without re-aiming the sniper at close range.

4) Sequence and outcome
- You enter this endgame skirmish with 2 squads left and 4 kills.
- You land light body damage on an already unshielded enemy (StatisticSharpshooter).
- A knockdown happens; you continue building damage (telemetry increments from 983 up through 1077+).
- You switch from Sentinel to a charge gauntlet and finish the low-HP enemy in close quarters.
- Your scoreboard updates to 5 kills and 1126 damage.
- At the conclusion of this clip, there are still 2 squads left, so the match isn’t finished yet—but you win the immediate duel and set up for the final fight with momentum and an extra kill secured.
