GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
============================================================
Here’s a concise play-by-play of what the frames show from this Apex Legends endgame sequence:

Context
- Map/position: Rooftop/gantry area on Olympus (Hammond-style yellow silos, cherry tree nearby).
- Ring/state: 2 squads left, ring timer ticking down; you’re in the final fight zone.
- Squad: Your team is full (all 3 alive).
- Loadout seen: Sentinel (sniper) + a close-range automatic (SMG/AR). Your shields are low (HUD tip appears).

Engagement
- You open at very close range (~9–14 m) with a scoped Sentinel shot and land 70 damage on an enemy Seer (wide-brim hat, blue outfit).
- You immediately disengage the scope, swap to your close-range gun, and finish the duel with a short burst. Damage readouts show 153 damage inflicted in the engagement, culminating in a “KNOCKED DOWN +150” on ShadyDre3XD.
- A teammate chips in a bit of damage (you can see a “13” tick) and is covering the push while you secure the down.

Downed enemy → Finisher
- You approach the downed Seer. The white interaction ring appears and you activate a finisher.
- The finisher animation is the “soccer ball juggle and kick” style, which strongly indicates you’re playing Mirage (the outfit and the theatrical, ball‑kick finisher match his kit).
- The sequence plays out fully: you juggle the red/white ball, style on the downed Seer, then rocket a kick that drops them for good.
- Tactical payoff: Performing the finisher recharges your shields (useful here because your shields were low).

Key takeaways and decisions
- Clean close-quarters snipe-to-SMG swap: You quick-scoped a body shot (70) and immediately swapped to secure the knock—textbook for Sentinel in tight spaces.
- Finisher choice: Risky with only two squads left, but you had teammate cover and needed shields; the finisher safely topped you up before the next duel.
- Outcome: One enemy from the last squad is eliminated. The remaining enemies (if any) are off-screen. The ring is closing soon, so you’ve regained shields right before the next push/peek.

What likely happens next (recommended follow-ups)
- Armor swap off the deathbox if it’s safer/faster than batting cells.
- Reload both weapons during/after the finisher’s end lag.
- Regroup with teammates, clear angles for the remaining opponent(s), and play cover around the yellow silos as the ring closes.
