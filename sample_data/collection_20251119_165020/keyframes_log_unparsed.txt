GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
============================================================
Here’s what the following frames show and how they line up with the captured game data.

1) What happens in the video
- Opening shot: You peek a rooftop/upper platform and land a clean body shot with a scoped Sentinel on an enemy Seer (target name “CoefficientConqueror”). The hit registers 70 red (flesh) damage. A Seer scan ring is visible, and your “shields low” tip pops up, indicating your shields are broken.
- Follow‑up and knock: You apply a small follow‑up tag (13 flesh damage) to the same target, which is enough to down them (DBNO). Immediately after, you close distance on the knock.
- Finisher: You get the “F for FINISHER” prompt on the downed Seer and start the finisher animation. The screen whiteout in the third frame is the finisher transition.

2) Correlation with the game data
- Damage events: The API logs two damage events on “CoefficientConqueror”: 70 (flesh) and 13 (flesh). That matches the first frame’s 70 body shot and the quick follow‑up to secure the knock.
- Weapons:
  - Active weapon on screen is the Sentinel (HUD shows “SENTINEL”). The scoped view and single big damage number (70) fit a Sentinel body shot on flesh.
  - Your secondary is an R‑99 (small weapon icon with 18 in mag), matching the earlier “inUse: R-99” snapshot from the API—likely from moments before swapping to the Sentinel.
- Inventory/ammo: The HUD shows 6/62 on the Sentinel. The API shows inventory_4: unknown_166 amount 62, which aligns with having 62 sniper ammo in reserve.
- Match state:
  - “2 squads left” in the HUD matches the API’s teams: 2, so you’re in the final fight.
  - Kills: 3, Assists: 0; Damage: 776. The API’s damage tab moves to 776 after the second event. The exact +10 vs. the 70+13 events is a common timing/desync quirk between per-hit logs and the periodic “tabs” stat refresh, but the end state (776 total) matches the HUD.
  - Your shields are broken (on-screen tip), which explains choosing to execute a finisher—finishers restore shields in current seasons.

3) Key moments
- Combat: 
  - Sentinel opening shot for 70 flesh on a Seer.
  - Immediate follow‑up hit for 13 to secure the knock.
- Decision making:
  - You start a finisher while shields are cracked to replenish shields mid‑fight—high risk/high reward in a 2‑squad endgame.
- Team interactions:
  - A teammate is visible nearby and not thirsted or downed, suggesting you have cover/support while you execute the finisher.
- Positional context:
  - You’re fighting on a raised platform near large yellow cylindrical structures and pink-leaf trees (an Olympus POI), controlling height in the final engagement.

4) Sequence and outcome
- Sequence:
  1) Swap to Sentinel and land a 70 body shot on “CoefficientConqueror” (flesh).
  2) Tag for 13 more damage to finish the down.
  3) Close in and trigger a finisher on the downed opponent to restore shields.
- Outcome:
  - You secure a knock on the last remaining squad and begin a finisher to recharge shields. The clip ends during the finisher; the final match result isn’t shown, but you’ve gained a significant advantage (one enemy down, shield restore incoming) in a 2‑squad endgame.
