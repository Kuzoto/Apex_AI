Here’s the sequence of events from the final fight, based on the logs and screenshots:

- Context
  - Two squads left (final fight), timer around 06:31.
  - Your team of three is fully alive: you, ShadowChild07, and OnlyDaymen.
  - You’re low on shields (on-screen prompt to recharge).

- Opening shot
  - Weapon: Sentinel (charged).
  - Distance ~14 meters.
  - You hit enemy CoefficientConqueror for 70 flesh (no armor).

- Push and weapon swap
  - You swap to the R-99 and push around the yellow silo.
  - You tag CoefficientConqueror again for 13 flesh while closing.

- Knockdown secured
  - Continuing the R-99 spray, you down a different opponent, SteadyDado (on-screen “KNOCKED DOWN +150”).
  - This leaves the enemy squad weakened: one player knocked, and at least one other (CoefficientConqueror) already damaged with no shields.

- Stats/state during this sequence
  - Kills stayed at 3 (you registered a knock, not a full elimination yet).
  - Assists: 0.
  - Match damage increased (logs show +70 then +13 to reach 776).
  - R-99 ammo shown at 18/64 during the push; you had 62 of an additional inventory item (unknown_166) at that time.
  - Your shields remained low; teammates were healthy and up.

Summary: In the final 2-squad engagement, you opened with a close-range Sentinel body shot on CoefficientConqueror (flesh), swapped to R-99, landed more shots (including a 13 flesh hit on the same target), and then secured a knock on SteadyDado. Your team held a 3vX advantage with one enemy down and another already cracked/no shields.
