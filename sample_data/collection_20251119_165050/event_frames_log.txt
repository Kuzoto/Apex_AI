Here’s a clear, chronological recap of the final fight and match wrap-up based on the logs and screenshots:

- Situation before the final fight
  - Only 2 squads were left as Ring 2 was closing.
  - Your whole team of three was alive (all three banners are up in the HUD).
  - You had a Sentinel and an R-99; your ultimate was available (cooldown 0).

- Opening tags and early damage
  - You swapped from Sentinel to the R-99 to engage.
  - You started landing light R-99 hits on an enemy named CosecantCommando (the enemy legend is Fuse, per the killfeed HUD text).
  - Damage events recorded: 2, 13, 13, 10, 13 (R-99 bullet increments), moving your running total damage from 1090 → 1103 → 1116.
  - The match tab briefly updated to 5 kills, 0 assists, 1191 damage with 2 squads remaining.

- The decisive spray
  - You continued to beam the Fuse with the R-99 from cover near the blue container as the ring closed.
  - Screenshots show cumulative damage numbers stacking rapidly: 13 → 65 → 78 → 101 → 114 → 153.
  - You cracked Fuse’s shields (Shield Broken – Fuse appears) and kept firing through “LOW AMMO,” emptying the mag as the total landed damage in that sequence reached 153.

- Finishing blow and final stats
  - Those last R-99 bullets downed and eliminated the final enemy (Fuse), immediately triggering the “YOU ARE THE CHAMPION” banner.
  - Your personal damage counter advanced through 1168 → 1204 → 1217 → 1230 during this endgame sequence; the match summary finalized at 6 kills, 0 assists, 1276 damage.
  - Victory was recorded (victory: true, teams dropped from 2 to 1).
  - After the win, your ultimate showed a small cooldown value (5), indicating it was ticking post-fight.

Key takeaways
- You closed out the match by swapping to the R-99 and securing the final kill on a Fuse with a sustained spray during Ring 2 closing.
- Team status remained strong (no downs shown) going into and during the last engagement.
- Final line: 6 kills, 0 assists, 1276 damage, Champion.
