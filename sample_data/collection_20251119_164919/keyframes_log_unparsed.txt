GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:
============================================================
Here’s a frame-by-frame style breakdown of what the clip shows and how it matches the game data:

1) Key actions and events
- Positioning and assessment: The clip opens with you posted on high ground overlooking a road and buildings. Round 1 is closing, and there are only 5 squads left, so it’s a low-team-count early ring.
- Banner recovery objective: A teammate’s death box is marked on the road below with a “RECOVER ~56s” timer. You prioritize getting to it.
- Movement to the box: You drop/slide down the road with melee out, then briefly pull out your primary weapon while approaching the site.
- Successful banner pickup: You reach the purple death box and recover “DeVayamos’s Banner,” earning “BANNER RECOVERY +75.”
- Planning a respawn: After recovery, the HUD reminder “Respawn Teammates at Beacons” appears, and a respawn beacon is marked roughly 150 m away. You start rotating back toward that direction as the clip ends.
- No direct combat: There are no shots taken or visible damage taken in this sequence. You’re moving with purpose, scanning, and securing the banner without engaging.

2) Correlating visuals with the provided game data
- Weapon in use (API): The API reports inUse: mp_weapon_agnostic_karambit_primary. On-screen, you’re repeatedly holding a karambit/knife in hand between actions. That matches the API exactly—your current equipped item during much of this segment is your melee/Heirloom.
- Actual loadout seen:
  - Primary: R-301 Carbine (visible with 18 rounds in the magazine—base mag, no extended).
  - Secondary: Sentinel (name clearly shown in the weapon HUD).
- Game phase and state:
  - Round 1 is closing (timer ~8:27 remaining in the closure window).
  - Only 5 squads left, which is unusually few for Round 1—implies a fast-paced early game with many teams eliminated.
  - Season 20+ systems are active: the center-top “PRESS 2 TO UPGRADE” prompt indicates you’ve earned a Legend Upgrade choice and haven’t selected it yet. Bottom-left also shows EVO progress readouts like “NEXT LVL … EVO.”
- Team status:
  - One teammate (ShadowLü) is alive.
  - One teammate (DeVayamos) is eliminated; their banner is recovered in this sequence.
  - Your own legend upgrade level indicator shows you’re not maxed; your teammate ShadowLü appears to be at upgrade level 4.

3) Important moments: combat, looting, movement, team interactions
- Movement: Controlled drop/slide from high ground to the roadway to reach the box quickly; you keep melee out much of the time for better FOV and nimbleness.
- Looting: Minimal—this is a banner-only grab. You do not rummage through the box; you immediately take the banner and prepare to rotate.
- Team interactions:
  - You respond to the “RECOVER” ping and complete it.
  - After recovery, the team objective shifts to a respawn; the HUD reminder appears and a beacon 120–150 m away is marked.
- Combat: None. There are some visual streaks/lines in one frame, but there’s no exchange of fire or hits on you. Kill feed activity is mostly other squads (including ring downs), not your team.

4) Sequence of events and outcome
- Start: On a rooftop/ledge above a road with Round 1 closing, 5 squads left, upgrade available. Melee (karambit) in hand, matching API.
- Rotate: You move downhill toward the marked death box. You briefly pull out the R-301 to check the surroundings, then stow back to melee while moving.
- Banner secured: You reach the purple box on the road and recover DeVayamos’s banner (+75).
- Next objective: The HUD prompts to respawn at beacons; a beacon ~150 m is marked. You start moving toward that route.
- Outcome of the clip: Successful banner recovery; no engagements; preparing to respawn the teammate. The respawn itself does not occur before the end of the shown frames.

Notable context and implications
- With 5 squads left in Round 1, playing for tempo is smart—recovering and respawning quickly could re-establish a full trio for midgame.
- You have a flexible loadout for mixed ranges (R-301 + Sentinel). If you respawn your teammate, you’ll likely need to escort them to safe loot, so holding the upgrade selection until you’re in cover could be deliberate.
- The “Press 2 to Upgrade” prompt suggests you can improve your kit/abilities immediately; choosing the right upgrade after the respawn (or while rotating) could be pivotal.

In short: This sequence is a clean, no-risk banner recovery with melee out to move quickly, a quick confirm of surroundings with the R-301, and a transition toward a nearby respawn beacon—fully consistent with the API showing the karambit in use.
